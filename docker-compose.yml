# compose file versions evolve with new docker versions, see compatibility matrix
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#compatibility-matrix
# On Dev machines, we use the latest docker version, however on servers
# we stick to fixed, older versions. We still use Docker v1.11 on servers, that leaves us with
# docker-compose version 2
version: '2'

  # service name convention: Same as github repo. If there are multiple services in one repo, naming

    # maps port from the container (second number) to this machine host (first number). The container port is can be
    # anything the service wants, but the host port has several limitions in for deployment. See README.md. Services
    # are easier deployed when host and container port are the same
